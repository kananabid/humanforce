# Test Automation Framework using Selenium, Java, Cucumber, JUnit, and Gradle

This is a test automation framework built using Selenium, Java, Cucumber, JUnit, and managed by Gradle.
It enables automated testing using behavior-driven development (BDD) principles.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK 17 is used)
- Gradle
- WebDriver compatible with the browser(s) you intend to test

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Load Gradle build if you see the popup**
3. **Make sure to load the project and dependencies properly ðŸŒš**

## Project Structure

- src/
    - main/
        - java/                          
        - resources (chromedrivers for Mac & Win)
    - test/
        - java/                          
        - humanforce.test (Test files and step definitions)
        - resources   (Cucumber feature files)
- build.gradle (Gradle build script)
- README.md

## Running Tests

1. [ ] **IMPORTANT: Execute tests using Gradle command: `.\gradlew runInitialTests`**
2. [ ] `DriverConfig` class **automatically** detects OS (Win or Mac) and initiates the driver
3. [ ] Tests are executed in headless mode

## Reporting

1. [ ] **Cucumber HTML reports is used for test reporting**
2. [ ] **Test report is in target/cucumber-html-reports/overview-failures.html**
3. [ ] (You can see other results in different tabs inside the html report)
4. [ ] **One user story inside `ManagerUserStories.feature` is deliberately created to fail in order to see the output in test report**
5. [ ] **Failed tests retry - Final report is in build/reports/tests/runFailedTests/index.html**

## Writing Tests

Tests are written in Cucumber feature files using Gherkin syntax located in `src/test/resources/features`.
Step definitions corresponding to these scenarios are written in Java located in `src/test/java/humanforce.test`.

- src/
    - test/
        - java/
        - humanforce.test/
            - driver (Contains `DriverConfig` class for Selenium WebDriver setup)
            - elements (Contains element locators and conditional enums)
            - stepDefinitions (Contains `Helper` and `UserStory` classes for step definitions)
            - utilities (Contains `CreateReport` class for test reporting)
- `TestRunner.java` (Main test runner class)
- `TestRunnerForFailed.java` (Runner class to **retry failed tests**)
- `README.md` (Project README)

## Notes

1. [ ] Comments are added to `Helper` class in order to explain the base methods used
2. [ ] Sleeps are added in between some steps in order to avoid unnecessary failures
(Ideally, they should not be present ðŸŒš)
