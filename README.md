# Test Automation Framework using Selenium, Java, Cucumber, JUnit, and Gradle

This is a test automation framework built using Selenium, Java, Cucumber, JUnit, and managed by Gradle.
It enables automated testing using behavior-driven development (BDD) principles.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK 17 is used)
- Gradle
- WebDriver compatible with the browser(s) you intend to test

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Load Gradle build if you see the popup**
3. **Make sure to load the project and dependencies properly ðŸŒš**

## Project Structure

- src/
    - main/
        - java/                          
        - resources
    - test/
        - java/                          
        - humanforce.test (Test files and step definitions)
        - resources   (Cucumber feature files)
- build.gradle (Gradle build script)
- README.md

## Running Tests

1. [ ] **IMPORTANT: Run this command on the terminal first: `chmod +x ./gradlew`**
2. [ ] **IMPORTANT: Execute tests using Gradle command: `.\gradlew runInitialTests`**
3. [ ] `DriverConfig` class **automatically** detects OS and initiates the driver
4. [ ] Tests are executed in headless mode

## Reporting

1. [ ] **Cucumber HTML reports is used for test reporting**
2. [ ] **Test report is in target/cucumber-html-reports/overview-failures.html**
3. [ ] (You can see other results in different tabs inside the html report)
4. [ ] **One user story inside `ManagerUserStories.feature` is deliberately created to fail in order to see the output in test report**
5. [ ] **Failed tests retry - Final report is in build/reports/tests/runFailedTests/index.html**

## Writing Tests

Tests are written in Cucumber feature files using Gherkin syntax located in `src/test/resources/features`.
Step definitions corresponding to these scenarios are written in Java located in `src/test/java/humanforce.test`.

- src/
    - test/
        - java/
        - humanforce.test/
            - driver (Contains `DriverConfig` class for Selenium WebDriver setup)
            - elements (Contains element locators and conditional enums)
            - stepDefinitions (Contains `Helper` and `UserStory` classes for step definitions)
            - utilities (Contains `CreateReport` class for test reporting)
- `TestRunner.java` (Main test runner class)
- `TestRunnerForFailed.java` (Runner class to **retry failed tests**)
- `README.md` (Project README)

## Notes

Comments are added to `Helper` class in order to explain the base methods used
Sleeps are added in between some steps in order to avoid unnecessary failures
(Ideally, they should not be present ðŸŒš)

It's impossible to automate the User Story below as the userflow does not correspond to the scenario on the second step:
1. [ ]    Prerequisite:
2. [ ]    Download the provided CSV file
3. [ ]    Update the EmployeeCode, FirstName, LastName, ShortName, Email columns
4. [ ]    with your own EmployeeCode, Name and Email respectively
5. [ ] 
6. [ ] As an authenticated user <Admin> ADM01
7. [ ] When I visit <Test instance>/IntegrationsCentral
8. [ ] Then I click on the 'Add New' button
9. [ ] Then I click on 'File Import'
10. [ ] Then I enter a task name
11. [ ] Then I select the Data type of 'Employee Basic' from the drop-down box
12. [ ] Then I click 'Browse'
13. [ ] Then I select and upload the provided CSV file
14. [ ] Then I click 'Next' at the bottom of the page
15. [ ] Then I click 'Next' at the bottom of the page(Field Mapping Page)
16. [ ] Then I see the pop-up appears asking for one time import
17. [ ] Then I click 'Import Only'
18. [ ] Then I should see 'File import complete'
19. [ ] Then I click 'Got it'
20. [ ] 
21. [ ] Then I navigate to <Test instance>/EmployeeManagement
22. [ ] Verify there is an employee with my first name and last name
